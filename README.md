* Blood Cell Segmentation Project for Multimedia Systems Course
* The project's goal is to create a blood cell counting and segmentation algorithm that counts the amount of blood cells in each sample using image processing techniques.
* To detect and count distinct types of blood cells in the sample, the system will go through multiple steps, including image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification.
* The purpose of this project is to develop a dependable and efficient instrument for healthcare professionals to count blood cells rapidly and accurately, which can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of medical diseases.
